# AI Development Workflow Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains a structured solution to the "Understanding the AI Development Workflow" assignment. It covers all required stages, from problem definition to deployment and reflection, using a combination of markdown reports and executable code in a Jupyter notebook.

## File Structure
- `Short_Answer_Questions.md` – Answers for CHUNK 1: Short Answer Questions
- `Case_Study.md` – Written responses for CHUNK 2: Case Study – Predicting Patient Readmission
- `Patient_Readmission.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with code for confusion matrix calculations and cross-validation (CHUNK 2)
- `Ethics_&_Bias.md` – Answers for CHUNK 3: Critical Thinking (Ethics, Bias, and Trade-offs)
- `Reflection_&_Workflow_Diagram.md` – Reflection and AI workflow diagram (CHUNK 4)
- `AI_Development_Workflow_Assignment_Prompts.md` – The original assignment prompts

## How to Use
1. **Read the Markdown Files:**
   - Each `.md` file corresponds to a section of the assignment and can be used directly in your report or as reference material.
2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Open `Patient_Readmission.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Follow the code cells for confusion matrix calculations and cross-validation. Replace placeholder variables (e.g., `X`, `y`) with your own data if needed.
3. **Workflow Diagram:**
   - The workflow diagram in `Reflection_&_Workflow_Diagram.md` is provided in Mermaid format. You can render it using Mermaid Live Editor or compatible markdown viewers.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages:
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `numpy`

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy
```

## Submission
- Use the markdown files and notebook to compile your final report (PDF or article as required by your course).
- Ensure all code is commented and all sections are clearly labeled.
